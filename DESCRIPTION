Description: Infer the posterior distributions of microRNA targets by
        probabilistically modelling the likelihood
        microRNA-overexpression fold-changes and sequence-based scores.
        Variaitonal Bayesian Gaussian mixture model (VB-GMM) is applied
        to log fold-changes and sequence scores to obtain the
        posteriors of latent variable being the miRNA targets. The
        final targetScore is computed as the sigmoid-transformed
        fold-change weighted by the averaged posteriors of target
        components over all of the features.
